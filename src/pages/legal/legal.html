      <p>The University of Dundee grants the End-User a non-transferable, non-exclusive licence to 1) use and install one copy
        of the Software on one processing unit and 2) use one copy of any Associated Materials. The End-User may not network
        the Software or otherwise use it on more than one processing unit at a time. The University of Dundee further grants
        the End-User a licence to make one copy of the Software solely for archival purposes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

        <li>Transfer the Software and the licence granted hereunder to any third party.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or use the Software to create any derivative software, unless such activity

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Warranty Liability and Indemnity</b>
      <p>The Software and Associated Materials are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without any warranty of any kind. The University

        damages or injury whatsoever or howsoever caused arising directly or indirectly out of the use of the Software or
        Associated Materials (except to the extent that such liability may not be lawfully excluded). The End-User agrees
        to indemnify the University of Dundee in relation to any claim arising out of that End-User&rsquo;s use of the Software

      <p>Within 30 days from the date of dispatch of the Software to the End-User, the End-User shall establish the efficacy
        of the Software for the End-User&rsquo;s purpose. If within that period there is any material unfitness of the Software

        University of Dundee, return or destroy all copies of any Associated Materials that accompanied the Software. If

        or b) the performance of the End-User&rsquo;s processing unit; the University of Dundee shall have no responsibility
        to refund the purchase price. In the event that the University of Dundee refunds the purchase price, this Agreement
        shall be deemed terminated from the date of such refund and the End-User shall thereafter have no licence in respect
        of the Software or Associated Materials.</p>
