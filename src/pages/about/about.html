  <p>Welcome to the Univesity of Dundee 'CommsCards' app.</p>
  <p>This app is a teaching aid designed for students to practice their Communication Skills with the aid of Flash Cards as
    well as OSCE Scenarios.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>On the front of the card there is a brief clinical vignette, and on the back an 'ideal' answer.</p>
  <p>Also avaliable are full size OSCE Scenarios: complete with a student question, patient script, and what is expected from
    the student.</p>
  <p>Within the 'Useful Links' section, there are both links to the relevant section of MedBlogs and Videos to aid Clinical
    Skills practice.</p>
