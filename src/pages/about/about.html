  <p>Welcome to the Univesity of Dundee 'CommsCards' app.</p>
  <p>This app is designed to aid students with their Communication Skills by giving a variety of Flash Cards to practice their
    skills against.</p>
  <p>On the front of the card there is a brief clinical vignette, and on the back an 'ideal' answer.</p>
  <p>Also avaliable are full size OSCE Scenarios: complete with a student question, patient script, and expectations.</p>
  <p>These should ideally be used once a student is comfortable with their skills.</p>
